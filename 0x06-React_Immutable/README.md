For this project, the aim is to learn the who, what, when, where and why of Immutable Objects, to learn how to use the Immutable.js library to bring immutability to Javascript, how to use Merge, Concat and Deep Merging and what a lazy `Seq` is. The differences between List and Map are observed as well.
